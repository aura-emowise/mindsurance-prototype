\## ABOUT MINDSURANCE

-What does the project do?-





\# Mindsurance is an innovative platform for assessing, immutably recording and insuring human cognitive potential.


The project allows you to assess and protect your unique thinking abilities and early ideas before they are physically realized.


It assigns a cognitive potential score (CPS), registers the "mental pattern" on the blockchain to provide a legal timestamp,


and offers cognitive insurance against risks such as loss of mental abilities,


unauthorized use, or delay in the implementation of ideas.



For financial risk assessment and underwriting,


Mindsurance uses the Google Maps Platform Geocoding API to include a geographic risk factor.





\# Mindsurance: Insurance for Your Genius Mind



&nbsp;The world's first platform to assess, blockchain-register, and insure your cognitive potential, powered by AI and Google Maps for financial security.

\# Why is the project useful?



In the knowledge economy, unrealized ideas and cognitive abilities are valuable, yet unprotected assets.


Mindsurance solves this problem by turning intangible intellectual potential into an insurable and investable asset.



For creators: It provides unprecedented protection against the loss, theft, or suppression of their ideas.



For the financial sector: Mindsurance opens up a whole new class of cognitive insurance products and provides accurate, data-driven risk assessments,


including important geographic factors via the Google Maps API, significantly improving underwriting processes and creating new investment opportunities.





\# What stack did we use?



Our Mindsurance demo prototype is built using the following tech stack:

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript


Framework: Vue.js 3


API:
Google Maps Platform Geocoding API: For location detection and use of geographic data in risk assessment.


Prototype technologies (simulated in prototype, intended for full implementation):


Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML)


Neural Interfaces (BCI/EEG)


Blockchain technology











\# How can users get started with the project (how to run locally)?



To run the Mindsurance project on your computer:


Clone the repository:


Generated bash


git clone https://github.com/aura-emowise/mindsurance-prototype.git


cd mindsurance-prototype


Use code with caution.


Bash


Get a Google Maps Platform API Key:
Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Enable "Geocoding API" for your project.
In the "Credentials" section, create an "API Key".
For local testing, temporarily remove all HTTP referrer restrictions (select "None" in "Application restrictions")
or add http://localhost:\* and file://\* to the allowed referrers for your key. Make sure payments are enabled for the project.


Add the API key to the code:

Open the app.js file in a text editor.
Find the line const GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY = 'YOUR\_GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY';
Replace 'YOUR\_GOOGLE\_MAPS\_API\_KEY' with your actual API key (inside the quotes).
Run:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
